### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! this is Shobhan. My domains are Site Reliability Engineering and DevOps.

With over 12 years of experience in software engineering field, I specialize in designing and implementing scalable, highly available, resilient systems using cloud-native technologies. I have a strong background in automating application deployment, implementing DevSecOps best practices and provisioning production-grade infrastructure, with hands-on expertise for leveraging tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, ArgoCD, GitLab and Ansible to streamline operations and maximize development efficiency.

Currently I am a member of the Engineering team at GEN (formerly Norton). My recent projects include provisioning and maintaining mission-critical cloud infrastructure that supports:

* 150M+ yearly authentications for the Interac Sign-In service
* 400K+ monthly transactions for the Interac Verification Service, serving key partners such as the Canada Revenue Agency and Costco

In addition to DevOps and SRE experience, I am adept in backend development, particularly building RESTful APIs and web applications using Java, Spring Framework, and Oracle RDBMS.
