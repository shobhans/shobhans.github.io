### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! this is Shobhan.

Site Reliability Engineer | DevOps Specialist

With over 10 years of experience in software engineering and infrastructure automation, I specialize in designing and implementing scalable, resilient systems using cloud-native technologies. I have a strong background in automating application deployment and managing production-grade infrastructure, with hands-on expertise for leveraging tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, ArgoCD, GitLab, and Ansible to streamline operations and ensure system reliability.

Currently part of the Engineering team at GEN (formerly Norton), I lead initiatives in cloud infrastructure architecture and DevOps best practices on my current projects. My recent work includes provisioning and maintaining mission-critical cloud infrastructure that supports:

* 150M+ yearly authentications for the Interac Sign-In service
* 400K+ monthly transactions for the Interac Verification Service, serving key partners such as the Canada Revenue Agency and Costco

In addition to DevOps and SRE responsibilities, I am adept in backend development, particularly building RESTful APIs and web applications using Java, Spring Framework, and Oracle RDBMS.
